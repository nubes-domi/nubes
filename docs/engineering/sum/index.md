_sum_ (_I am_) is the IdP in Nubes.

# Purposes

- Store user identifiers, credentials, roles and details.
- Authenticate users to internal applications and to external apps that supports so.
- Allow administrators to manage such users

# Why

While there are a couple of existing open source solutions out there (like Ory,
Keycloak), none of them seem to be AGPL licensed, or supporting more than just
OIDC/SAML.

The very ambitious goal is to have one server that can identify you to web app,
mobile apps, computers, Samba shares and all the rest.

The service would be graphically designed using the Nubes framework.

# Protocols

## OpenID Connect

**Required**. The latest and shiniest Web Authentication protocol. All new apps should be using this.

## SAML

**Maybe**. The enterprise weirdo. Speaks XML (ðŸ‘»)

## LDAP, Kerberos, RADIUS

**Unlikely**. Potentially authenticate to computers (Windows Logon, SSH) and networks (WPA2/3 Enterprise)

## Authentication

- Traditional username & password.
- TOTP
- Yubi?
- TouchID/FaceID?
